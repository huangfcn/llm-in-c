# Qwen3.8-27B

This directory contains the Qwen3.8-27B model adapter and its target implementations. The current artifact compiles the language model for text generation; it does not include the checkpoint's vision tower.

## Model graph

Values below are read from the pinned checkpoint and enforced by the runtime headers and image packers.

| Property | Value |
|---|---:|
| Language-model layers | 64 |
| Layer pattern | 48 gated DeltaNet layers, 16 full-attention layers; full attention every fourth layer |
| Hidden size | 5,120 |
| MLP intermediate size | 17,408 |
| Vocabulary rows | 248,320 |
| Full attention | 24 query heads, 4 KV heads, head dimension 256, partial rotary dimension 64 |
| DeltaNet | 16 key heads, 48 value heads, head dimension 128, convolution width 4 |
| Maximum position setting | 262,144 tokens in the source configuration; target runtime limits are smaller |
| MTP | one separately packed draft layer plus projection and normalization tensors |

The hybrid graph changes the optimization problem. DeltaNet layers carry recurrent and convolution state instead of a growing KV cache; full-attention layers use grouped-query attention and do require KV storage. A useful target backend must optimize both paths and the transitions between them.

The Apple target uses affine four-bit groups of 64 values. MTP normalization
tensors in that checkpoint are already stored as direct multipliers and are
copied without adding one during packing. The memory-constrained Jetson target
instead uses a dynamically mixed IQ1 GGUF; its quality and performance results
are not comparable to the affine-Q4 target.

## Targets

| Target | Status | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| Apple M3 Pro | End-to-end text generation, batched prefill, adaptive MTP and local serving measured on device | [target documentation](targets/apple-m3-pro/README.md) |
| Jetson Orin Nano Super 8 GB | Resident full-CUDA service measured at 4.17 tok/s; final interactive trial rejected after 114–156 s Chatbox turns and near-1 GiB process swap | [target documentation](targets/jetson-orin/README.md) |

Quality and performance are target-specific. The five-case ARC-Easy adaptation is a smoke test rather than an official benchmark score; its raw outputs are recorded in [`benchmarks/arc-easy-5/results-macos-m3-pro.json`](benchmarks/arc-easy-5/results-macos-m3-pro.json).
